# Geralt von Riva - Der weiße Wolf

Zusammenfassung: Geralt ist ein sogenannter Hexer. Hexer sind zahlreiche Mutationen unterlaufen um ihre Kampfertigkeiten zu steigern um dadurch die Menschen vor Monstern zu beschützen (Mosterjäger).
Das interssante an seinen Geschichten ist jedoch das sich Gut und Böse nicht immer eindeutig feststellen.
Was sind Monster? Kreaturen die monströs aussehen oder auch Menschen der Handlungen monströs sind?

Abstract:
Geralt of Rivia is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short stories and novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Geralt, one of the few remaining witchers on the Continent, is a traveling monster slayer for hire, mutated and trained from an early age to slay deadly beasts.


Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna, gave him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at Kaer Morhen - the stronghold of the witchers. Geralt survived mutations during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gained various witcher traits: high resistance to injury, poison and disease, slowed ageing, but also infertility. He resisted the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than most, which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder Speech as "Gwynbleidd" (close to the Welsh translation "Blaidd Gwyn"[2]), the White Wolf. From the arduous training of Witchers, he became a master swordfighter and learnt how to use the Signs, simple spells used by the witchers.
